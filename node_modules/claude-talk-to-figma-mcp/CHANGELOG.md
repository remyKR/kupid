## [0.5.3] - 2025-06-20

### Added
- Added Windows-specific build command (`build:win`: `tsup`) for improved cross-platform compatibility
- Enhanced build process to support development on Windows systems without chmod dependency

### Fixed
- Resolved Windows build compatibility issues where `chmod` command would fail on Windows systems
- Improved developer experience for Windows users by providing dedicated build script

### Changed
- Separated Unix/Linux build process (with executable permissions) from Windows build process
- Updated installation documentation to reflect platform-specific build commands

## [0.5.2] - 2025-06-19

### Fixed
- Fixed critical opacity handling bug in `set_stroke_color` where `a: 0` (transparent) was incorrectly converted to `a: 1` (opaque)
- Fixed stroke weight handling where `strokeWeight: 0` (no border) was incorrectly converted to `strokeWeight: 1`
- Resolved problematic `||` operator usage that affected falsy values in color and stroke operations

### Added
- Extended `applyDefault()` utility function to handle stroke weight defaults safely
- Added `FIGMA_DEFAULTS.stroke.weight` constant for centralized stroke configuration
- Comprehensive test suite for `set_stroke_color` covering edge cases and integration scenarios
- Enhanced validation for RGB components in stroke operations

### Changed
- Improved architectural consistency by applying the same safe defaults pattern from `set_fill_color` to `set_stroke_color`
- Enhanced separation of concerns between MCP layer (business logic) and Figma plugin (pure translator)
- Renamed `weight` parameter to `strokeWeight` for better clarity and consistency
- Updated Figma plugin to expect complete data from MCP layer instead of handling defaults internally

### Technical Details
- Replaced `strokeWeight: strokeWeight || 1` with `applyDefault(strokeWeight, FIGMA_DEFAULTS.stroke.weight)`
- Enhanced type safety with proper `Color` and `ColorWithDefaults` interface usage
- Improved error messages and validation for better debugging experience

## [0.5.1] - 2025-06-15
